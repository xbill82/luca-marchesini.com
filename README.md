===================

This repository aims to share my experiments with MVC libraries, responsive design frameworks and workflow automation tools in the real world, since the website has no particular interest (aside software development, I do some storytelling: this is my website as a storyteller in France). Also, I simply wanted to have a Git server and don't really bother to share my code with you all.
